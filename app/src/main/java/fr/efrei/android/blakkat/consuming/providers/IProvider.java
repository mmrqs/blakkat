/**
 * This class serves as a common ground for every Provider interface
 * It doesnâ€™t coerce them into implementing these declared methods,
 * it allows to generically call relevant methods in batch rather than
 * taking each interface individually.
 * Due to {@link retrofit2.Retrofit} not supporting parametrized (<T>)
 * interfaces, this cannot be parametrized and type cannot be truly enforced.
 * This, however, seems like a reasonable trade.
